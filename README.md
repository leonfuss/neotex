# NeoTeX
Welcome to NeoTeX, the future of scientific typesetting! 

While programming languages have continually evolved to become more developer-friendly, 
the field of scientific writing has lagged behind in terms of user experience. NeoTeX 
aims to change that narrative. With its modern rewriten engine, real-time error feedback, 
lightning-fast compilation, and user-centric features like clear error messages and 
integrated plotting, NeoTeX revolutionizes the way scientists and researchers create documents. 

A leap forward in scientific writing, finally aligning the field with the 
developer-friendly ethos that has transformed the programming world.
